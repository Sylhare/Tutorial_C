## Tutorial C 

[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/for-sharks.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)

I have started learning with [Dev C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/files/latest/download)
It's simple and free.

Here are some code example to begin with C,
I made them a long time ago (that's why it's not all in english),
but I figured it could help.

If you have any question, feel free.
